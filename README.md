# Keypad Secured Toggle of a Micro-controller Port
 A university project on Micro-controllers, where the main idea is to secure the toggle of a port (port B).

![Overview](demo/Overview.png)

<br>

## üòé **Quick start**

<br>

### If you wanna go around everything, exploring the code as well, compiling it, etc. Then you would download [mikroC PRO for PIC](https://www.mikroe.com/mikroc-pic).

<br>

### But to just to give it a try, you can just do the simulation part:

###  First, [download](https://www.google.com/search?q=Proteus+8+Professional+download) Proteus 8 Professional, from one of these sources.

### Now all you gotta do, is to navigate to the `Project Simulation` folder and then run the `Keypad secured toggle of Port B - Simulation.pdsprj` file using Proteus.

<br>

### That's all you need to know to start, have fun! ‚úÖ

### I have provided a .pptx presentation ( `Summary - Keypad Password-Secured Toggle of Port B - Team 10.pptx` ) for this project that was used while submitting it for my university, hope it helps you knowing more about the project.
